# Bio Informatics Project
This is a undergrad bioinformatics projects from a class where we were being introduce to some ML models and wanted to do this little project to see how we could apply the models we learned in class to a Bio-related project.

## Ideas:
We could combine the Models that we have and let them vote (like in the random forrest) and see how well the combined model performs.
